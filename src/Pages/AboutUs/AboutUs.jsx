      <p className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">Welcome to our Book Vibe:</p>
      <p className="text-[#131313CC] mb-8">At Book Vibe, we are more than just ink on paper. We re a community of bibliophiles, dreamers, and word wanderers. Our shelves are stacked with stories waiting to be explored, and our hearts beat in rhythm with the turning of pages.</p>
      
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Our Story:</h3>
      <p className="text-[#131313CC] mb-8">Every great tale begins somewhere. Ours started with a dog-eared library card and a love for the smell of old books. We believe that stories have the power to transport us—to far-off lands, ancient civilizations, and parallel universes. And so, we embarked on this journey to curate literary treasures, celebrate authors, and ignite the spark of imagination.</p>
